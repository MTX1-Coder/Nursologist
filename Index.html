            <h2>What Is Social Media Addiction?</h2>
            <p>
                Social media addiction means spending too much time on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, or Twitter. It’s not just about using them often – it’s about feeling like you must check your phone all the time, even when you don’t need to. This constant need to scroll, like, and post can take over your life, leaving less time for real-life activities like work, studies, or family.
